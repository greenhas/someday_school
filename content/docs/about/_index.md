# guiding principles

## fidelity

## accessibility

### modernization

- update verb forms when confident about not changing the meaning
	- "I would" becomes "I want"
	- "I shall" becomes "I will"
- modernize pronouns
	- "mine" becomes "my" when appropriate 
	
- remove "should" constructions

- World English Bible is source

### gender neutrality

- "fathers" replaced with "ancestors" when familial ties are meant
- "brethren" replaced with "siblings"
- "men" becomes "people" when meant generally
- "men" becomes "humans" when referring to humankind
- the general "he" becomes "they"
	- while I'm all for "they" as a singular pronoun, there are some cases where pluralizing other parts of the sentence helps it read better without changing the meaning; I've done that

### simplicity

- remove "and it came to pass" in many/most cases?
- remove "and" at the beginning of a sentence when the meaning is clear
- remove "for" at the beginning of a sentence when the meaning is clear
- pronouns occasionally replaced with names when the antecedent is clear. 
- simplify syntax when reasonably sure it doesn't change the meaning
- tweak errors in conjugation for which no other interpretation seems reasonable
- added clarifying prepositions
- added parallel structure to some sentences
- split some sentences and added subjects

### formatting

- add quotation marks to snippets of dialogue
- add block quotes to extended speeches or embedded documents

## novelty

### punctuation

From Mosiah 1 (Mosiah 2 LDS): "or the commandments of God which shall be delivered unto you by him" — a comma before which changes things
