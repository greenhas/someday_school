Now there was no more contention in all the land of Zarahemla among all the people which belonged to King Benjamin, so King Benjamin had continual peace all the remainder of his days. 

# King Benjamin teaches his sons

King Benjamin had three sons, and he named them Mosiah, Helorum, and Helaman. He had them taught in all the language of his ancestors, so that they could become people of understanding and know concerning the prophecies spoken by the mouths of their ancestors which were delivered to them by the hand of the Lord. He also taught them concerning the records that were engraved on the plates of brass, saying: 

> My sons, I want you to remember that if it were not for these plates that contain these records and these commandments, we would have suffered in ignorance (even at the present time), not knowing the mysteries of God. It was not possible that our father Lehi could have remembered all these things to  teach them to his children, except it were for the help of these plates. He, having been taught in the language of the Egyptians, could read these engravings and teach them to his children, so that they could teach them to their children, and so fulfilling the commandments of God, even down to the present time. I tell you, my sons, if it were not for these things (which have been kept and preserved by the hand of God so that we can read and understand of his mysteries and have his commandments always before our eyes), that even our ancestors would have dwindled in unbelief. We would have been like unto our siblings, the Lamanites, who know nothing concerning these things (or do not even believe in them when they are taught them) because of the traditions of their ancestors, which are not correct. My sons, I want you to remember that these sayings are true and that these records are true. Behold also the plates of Nephi, which contain the records and sayings of our ancestors from the time they left Jerusalem until now. They are true, and we can know of their surety because we have them before our eyes. Now, my sons, I want you to remember to search them diligently, so that you can profit from them. I want you to keep the commandments of God so that you can prosper in the land according to the promises which the Lord made unto our ancestors. 

King Benjamin taught his sons many more things which are not written in this book. 

# King Benjamin selects Mosiah as his successor and prepares to speak to the people

After King Benjamin had finished teaching his sons, he grew old and saw that he must very soon go the way of all the earth. Therefore, he thought it expedient to confer the kingdom on one of his sons. Therefore, he had Mosiah brought before him, and these are the words he said to him: 

> My son, I want you to make a proclamation throughout all this land, among all this people (or the people of Zarahemla and the people of Mosiah which dwell in this land), so that they can gather together. The next day, I will proclaim to my people out of my own mouth that you are a king and a ruler over this people (which the Lord our God has given us). Moreover, I will give this people a name, so that they can be distinguished above all the people which the Lord God has brought out of the land of Jerusalem. 

> I do this because they have been a diligent people in keeping the commandments of the Lord. I give them a name that will never be blotted out, except through transgression. Yes, and moreover I tell you that if this highly favored people of the Lord falls into transgression and becomes a wicked and an adulterous people, the Lord will deliver them up so that they become weak, like unto their siblings. He will no longer preserve them by his matchless and marvelous power, as he has preserved our ancestors until now. For I tell you that if he had not extended his arm in the preservation of our ancestors, they must have fallen into the hands of the Lamanites and become victims to their hatred. 

After King Benjamin had finished these sayings to his son, he gave him charge concerning all the affairs of the kingdom. Moreover, he also gave him charge concerning the records engraven on the plates of brass, the plates of Nephi, the sword of Laban, and the ball or director that led our ancestors through the wilderness (which was prepared by the hand of the Lord, so that they could be led, every one according to the heed and diligence which they gave unto him; therefore, as they were unfaithful, they did not prosper or progress in their journey but were driven back, and incurred the displeasure of God upon them; therefore, they were smitten with famine and sore afflictions, to stir them up in memory of their duty). 

# The people respond to Mosiah's invitation to gather
 
 Mosiah went and did as his father commanded him. He proclaimed unto all the people in the land of Zarahemla, so that they could gather themselves together to go up to the temple to hear the words that his father would speak unto them. After Mosiah had done as his father had commanded him and made a proclamation throughout all the land, the people gathered themselves together throughout all the land so that they could go up to the temple to hear the words that King Benjamin would speak unto them. 
 
 There was a great number of people (even so many that they did not number them), for they had multiplied greatly and become great in the land. They also took of the firstborn of their flocks so that they could offer sacrifice and burnt offerings, according to the law of Mosesâ€”and also so that they could give thanks to the Lord their God, who had brought them out of the land of Jerusalem, delivered them out of the hands of their enemies, and appointed just people to be their teachers (and also a just man to be their king, who had established peace in the land of Zarahemla and taught them to keep the commandments of God so that they could rejoice and be filled with love toward God and all people). 
 
 When they came up to the temple, they pitched their tents around it, every man according to his family, consisting of his wife, and his children, and their children, from the oldest down to the youngest. Every family was separate, one from another, and they pitched their tents around the temple, every man having the door of his tent toward the temple, so that they could remain in their tents and hear the words which King Benjamin would speak unto them. Because the multitude was so great, King Benjamin could not teach them all within the walls of the temple. Therefore, he had a tower built, so that his people could hear the words he would speak unto them. He began to speak to his people from the tower, and they could not all hear his words, because of the greatness of the multitude. Therefore, he had the words he said written down and sent forth among those that were not under the sound of his voice, so that they could also receive his words.
 
 # King Benjamin addresses the people 
 
 These are the words which King Benjaimn said and had written: 
 
 ## King Benjamin speaks of his service to the people
 
> My siblings, all you that have assembled yourselves together, you that can hear the words I will tell you today. I have not commanded you to come up here to trifle with the words I will speak but so that you would listen to me and open your ears so that you can hear, your hearts so that you can understand, and your minds so that the mysteries of God can be unfolded to your view. I have not commanded you to come here so that you would fear me or think that I, of myself, am more than a mortal man. I am like all of you, subject to all kinds of infirmities in body and mind. Yet, I have been chosen by this people, consecrated by my father, allowed by the hand of the Lord to be a ruler and a king over this people, and kept and preserved by his matchless power to serve you with all the might, mind, and strength which the Lord has granted unto me. I tell you that I have been allowed to spend my days in your service (even up to now) and have not sought gold, silver, or any kind of riches from you; neither have I allowed you to be confined in dungeons, to make slaves one of another, or to murder, plunder, steal, or commit adultery. I have not even allowed you to commit any kind of wickedness, and I have taught you that you should keep the commandments of the Lord in all things which he has commanded you. I, myself, have even labored with my own hands so that I could serve you, so that you would not be burdened with taxes, and so that nothing would come upon you that was grievous to be carried. Of all these things that I have said, you yourselves are witnesses today.

> Yet, my siblings, I have not done these things so that I could boast; neither do I tell these things so that I could accuse you. I tell you these things, so that you can know that I can answer before God today with a clear conscience. Behold, I tell you, I do not desire to boast because I told you that I had spent my days in your service, for I have only been in the service of God. Behold, I tell you these things so that you can learn wisdom, so that you can learn that when you are in the service of your fellow beings, you are only in the service of your God. Behold, you have called me your king. If I (whom you call your king) do labor to serve you, then should you not labor to serve one another? Behold, if I (whom you call your king and who has spent his days in your service and yet has been in the service of God) merit any thanks from you, how you should thank your heavenly King! 

> I tell you, my siblings, that if you rendered all the thanks and praise your whole souls have power to possess to that God who has created you, kept and preserved you, made you rejoice, and granted that you should live in peace one with another; I tell you that if you served him who has created you from the beginning, is preserving you from day to day (by lending you breath that you can live, move, and do according to your own will), and is even supporting you from one moment to another; I say, if you served him with all your whole soul, you would still be unprofitable slaves. Behold, all that he requires of you is to keep his commandments, and he has promised you that if you keep his commandments, you will prosper in the land. He never varies from that which he has said; therefore, if you keep his commandments, he blesses you and prospers you. In the first place, he has created you and granted unto you your lives, for which you are indebted unto him. Secondly, he requires you to do as he has commanded you; if you do this, he immediately blesses you and, therefore, he has paid you. You are still indebted unto him and will be, forever and ever. Therefore, of what have you to boast? I ask, can you say anything of yourselves? I answer "no." You cannot say that you are even as much as the dust of the earth. You were created of the dust of the earth, but behold, it belongs to him who created you. Even I (whom you call your king), am no better than you yourselves are, for I am also of the dust.

## King Benjamin steps down as king

>  You see that I am old and am about to yield up this mortal body to its mother earth. Therefore, just as I told you that I had served you walking with a clear conscience before God, I have also had you assemble yourselves together now so that I could be found blameless and so that your blood will not come upon me when I will stand to be judged by God of the things he has commanded me concerning you. I tell you that I have had you assemble yourselves together so that I can rid my clothing of your blood (at this period of time when I am about to go down to my grave), so that I can go down in peace, and so that my immortal spirit can join the choirs above in singing the praises of a just God. 

> Moreover, I tell you, that I have had you assemble yourselves together, so that I can declare to you that I can no longer be your teacher or your king. Even now, my whole body trembles greatly while attempting to speak to you. But the Lord God supports me, has allowed me that I should speak unto you, and has commanded me to declare to you today that my son Mosiah is a king and ruler over you. Now, my siblings, I want you to do as you have done until now. Just as you have kept my commandments and also the commandments of my father (and have prospered and been kept from falling into the hands of your enemies), if you will keep the commandments of my son (or the commandments of God which will be delivered unto you by him), you will prosper in the land, and your enemies will have no power over you. 

## King Benjamin warns against contention

> But, my people, beware unless contentions arise among you, and you wish to obey the evil spirit (which was spoken of by my father Mosiah). Behold, there is sadness pronounced upon them who wish to obey that spirit. If they wish to obey that spirit and then remain and die in their sins, the same drink damnation to their own souls. They receive for their wages an everlasting punishment, having transgressed the law of God contrary to their own knowledge. 

> I tell you that there is not one among you (except it be your little children) that has not been taught concerning these things, that does not know that you are eternally indebted to your Heavenly Father, to render to him all that you have and are, that has not been taught concerning the records which contain the prophecies which have been spoken by the holy prophets (even down to the time of our ancestor Lehi left Jerusalem) and also all that has been spoken by our ancestors until now. And behold, also, they said that which was commanded them of the Lord; therefore, they are just and true. And now, I tell you, my siblings, that after you have known and have been taught all these things, if you should transgress, and go contrary to that which has been spoken, that you do withdraw yourselves from the Spirit of the Lord, that it can have no place in you to guide you in wisdom's paths, that you can be blessed, prospered, and preserved. I tell you, that the man that doeth this, the same cometh out in open rebellion against God; therefore, he wishes to obey the evil spirit, and becometh an enemy to all righteous; therefore, the Lord has no place for him, for he dwelleth not in unholy temples. Therefore, if that man repenteth not, and remaineth and dieth an enemy to God, the demands of Divine Justice awakens his immortal soul to a lively sense of his own guilt, which causes him to shrink from the presence of the Lord, and fills his breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish, which is like an unquenchable fire, whose flames ascendeth up forever and ever. And now I tell you, that mercy has no claim on that man; therefore, his final doom is to endure a never ending torment. All you old men, and also you young men, and you little children, which can understand my words,(for I have spoken plain unto you, that you can understand,) I pray that you should awake to a memory of the awful situation of those that have fallen into transgression; and moreover, I would desire that you should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end, they are received into Heaven,  so that they can dwell with God, in a state of never ending happiness. Remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God has spoken it. And again my siblings, I would call your attention, for I have somewhat more to tell you for behold, I have things to , concerning that which is to come; and the things which I will , are made known unto me, by an Angel from God. And he said unto me, Awake; and I awoke, and beheld, he stood before me. And he said unto me, Awake, and hear the words which I will tell you: for behold, I am come to declare unto you the glad tidings of great joy. For the Lord has heard the prayers, and has judged of thy righteousness, and has sent me to declare unto you that  you can rejoice; and that  you can declare unto thy people, that they can also be filled with joy. For behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with power, the Lord omnipotent who reigneth, which was, and is from all eternity to all eternity, will come down from Heaven, among the children of men, and will dwell in a tabernacle of clay, and will go forth amongst men, working mighty miracles, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, causing the lame to walk, the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear, and curing all kinds of diseases; and he will cast out Devils, or the evil spirits which dwelleth in the hearts of the children of men. And lo, he will suffer temptations, and pain of body, hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer, except it be unto death: for behold, blood cometh from every pore, so great will be his anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of his people. And he will be called Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of Heaven and Earth, the creator of all things, from the beginning; and his mother will be called Mary. And lo, he cometh unto his own, that salvation can come unto the children of men, even through faith on his name; and even after all this, they will consider him a man, and say that he has a Devil , and will scourge him, and will crucify him. And he will rise the third day from the dead; and behold, he standeth to judge the world. And behold, all these things are done, that a righteous judgment can come upon the children of men. For behold, and also his blood atoneth for the sins of those who have fallen by the transgression of them, or who have ignorantly sinned. But wo, we unto him who knoweth that he rebelleth against God: for salvation  cometh to none such, except it be through repentance and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ. And the Lord God has sent his Holy Prophets among all the children of men, to declare these things to every kindred, nation, and tongue, so that whosoever should believe that Christ should come, the same can receive remission of their sins, and rejoice with very great joy, even as though he had already come among them. Yet the Lord saw that his people were a stiffnecked people, and he appointed unto them a law, even the law of Moses. And many signs, and wonders, and types, and shadows shewed he unto them, concerning his coming; and also Holy Prophets said unto them concerning his coming; and yet they hardened their hearts, and understood not that the law of Moses availeth nothing, except it were through the atonement of his blood; and even if it were possible that little children could sin, they could not be saved; but I tell you, they are blessed: for behold, as in Adam, or by nature they fall, even so the blood of Christ atoneth for their sins. And moreover, I tell you, that there will be no other names given, nor no other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent. For behold, he judgeth, and his judgment is just, and the infant perisheth not, that dieth in his infancy; but people drinketh damnation to their own souls, except they humble themselves, and become as little children, and believeth that salvation was, and is, and is to come, in and through the atoning blood of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent: for the natural man is an enemy of God, and has been, from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever; but if he yieldeth to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man, and becometh a saint, through the atonement of Christ, the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child submits to his father. And moreover, I tell you, that the time will come, when the knowledge of a Saviour will spread throughout every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. And behold, when that time cometh, none will be found blameless before God, except it be little children, only through repentance and faith on the name of the Lord God Omnipotent; and even now, when  you shalt have taught thy people the things which the Lord thy God has commanded you, even then are they found no more blameless in the sight of God, only according to the words which I have spoken unto you. And now, I have spoken the words which the Lord God has commanded me. And the Lord says: They will stand as a bright testimony against this people, at the judgment day; whereof, they will be judged, every man, according to his works, whether they be good, or whether they be evil; and if they be evil, they are consigned to an awful view of their own guilt and abominations, which causes them to shrink from the presence of the Lord, into a state of misery and endless torment, from whence they can no more return; therefore, they have drunk damnation to their own souls. -- Therefore, they have drunk out of the cup of the wrath of God, which justice could no more deny unto them, than it could deny that Adam should fall, because of his partaking of the forbidden fruit; therefore, mercy could have a claim on them no more forever. And their torment is as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flames are unquenchable, and whose smoke ascendeth up forever and ever. Thus has the Lord commanded me. Amen.
