There was no more contention in all the land of Zarahemla among all the people which belonged to King Benjamin, so King Benjamin had continual peace all the remainder of his days. 

## King Benjamin speaks to his sons

King Benjamin had three sons, and he named them Mosiah, Helorum, and Helaman. He caused them to be taught in all the language of his ancestors, that thereby they could become men of understanding and know concerning the prophecies which had been spoken by the mouths of their ancestors which were delivered to them by the hand of the Lord. King Benjamin also taught them concerning the records which were engraven on the plates of brass, saying: 

> My sons, I want you to remember that if it were not for these plates which contain these records and these commandments, we would have suffered in ignorance (even at this present time) not knowing the mysteries of God. It was not possible that our ancestor Lehi could have remembered all these things (to teach them to his children) without the help of these plates. He (having been taught in the language of the Egyptians) could read these engravings and teach them to his children, that thereby they could teach them to their children, and so fulfilling the commandments of God even down to the present time. 

> I say unto you, my sons, that if it were not for these things (which have been kept and preserved by the hand of God so that we can read and understand his mysteries and have his commandments always before our eyes) even our ancestors would have dwindled in unbelief. We would have been like our siblings, the Lamanites, who know nothing concerning these things or do not even believe these things when they are taught them because of the traditions of their ancestors which are not correct. O my sons, I want you to remember that these sayings are true and also that these records are true. 

> Behold also the plates of Nephi, which contain the records and the sayings of our ancestors from the time they left Jerusalem until now. They are true, and we can know of their certainty because we have them before our eyes. Now, my sons, I want you to remember to search them diligently (that you may profit thereby), and I want you to keep the commandments of God (that you may prosper in the land according to the promises which the Lord made unto our ancestors). 

Many more things did King Benjamin teach his sons which are not written in this book. 

## King Benjamin speaks to Mosiah

After King Benjamin had finished teaching his sons, he became old, and he saw that he must very soon go the way of all the earth. Therefore, he thought it wise to confer the kingdom upon one of his sons. Therefore, he had Mosiah brought before him, and these are the words he spoke to him:

> My son, I want you to make a proclamation throughout all this land, among all this people (or the people of Zarahemla) and the people of Mosiah which dwell in the land, that thereby they may be gathered together. Tomorrow, I will proclaim unto my people out of my own mouth that you are a king and a ruler over this people, which the Lord our God has given us. 

> Moreover, I will give this people a name, so that thereby they may be distinguished above all the people which the Lord God has brought out of the land of Jerusalem. I do this because they have been a diligent people in keeping the commandments of the Lord. I give unto them a name that will never be blotted out, except through transgression. Yes, and moreover I say unto you that if this highly favored people of the Lord falls into transgression and becomes a wicked and adulterous people, the Lord will deliver them up that thereby they become weak like unto their siblings. He will no more preserve them by his matchless and marvelous power, as he has preserved our ancestors up to now. I say unto you that if the Lord had not extended his arm in the preservation of our ancestors, they would have fallen into the hands of the Lamanites and become victims to their hatred. 

After King Benjamin had finished these sayings to his son, he gave Mosiah charge concerning all the affairs of the kingdom. Moreover, he also gave Mosiah charge concerning the records which were engraven on the plates of brass, the plates of Nephi, the sword of Laban, and the ball or director, which led our ancestors through the wilderness and was prepared by the hand of the Lord that thereby they could be led (every one) according to the heed and diligence which they gave unto the Lord. Therefore, as they were unfaithful, they did not prosper or progress in their journey but were driven back and incurred the displeasure of God upon them. Therefore, they were smitten with famine and sore afflictions to stir them up in remembrance of their duty. 

## Mosiah gathers the people

Mosiah went and did as his father commanded him. He proclaimed unto all the people which were in the land of Zarahemla that thereby they could gather themselves together to go up to the temple, to hear the words which his father would speak unto them. After Mosiah had done as his father had commanded him (and made a proclamation throughout all the land), the people gathered themselves together throughout all the land so that they could go up to the temple to hear the words which King Benjamin would speak unto them. 

There were a great number, even so many that they did not number them; they had multiplied exceedingly and waxed great in the land. They also took of the firstborn of their flocks so that they could offer sacrifice and burnt offerings according to the law of Moses and also so that they could give thanks to the Lord their God, who had brought them out of the land of Jerusalem, delivered them out of the hands of their enemies, and appointed just people to be their teachers (and also a just man to be their king, who had established peace in the land of Zarahemla and taught them to keep the commandments of God so that they could rejoice and be filled with love towards God and all people). 

When they came up to the temple, they pitched their tents round about, every man according to his family, consisting of his wife, and his children, and their children (from the eldest down to the youngest), every family being separate, one from another. They pitched their tents around the temple, every man having his tent with its door towards the temple, that thereby they could remain in their tents and hear the words which King Benjamin would speak unto them. Because the multitude was so large, King Benjamin could not teach them all within the walls of the temple. Therefore, he caused a tower to be erected, that thereby his people could hear the words which he would speak unto them. 

## King Benjamin speaks to the people

King Benjamin began to speak to his people from the tower. They could not all hear his words because of the size of the multitude. Therefore, he caused the words he spoke to be written and sent forth among those that were not under the sound of his voice, so that they could also receive his words. These are the words which he spoke and caused to be written: 

### King Benjamin establishes his clear conscience

> My siblings, all you who have assembled yourselves together, you that can hear the words which I will speak unto you this day: I have not commanded you to come up here to trifle with the words which I will speak but to listen to me and open your ears that you may hear, your hearts that you may understand, and your minds that the mysteries of God may be unfolded to your view. 

> I have not commanded you to come up here so that you fear me or so that you think that I, of myself, am more than a mortal man. I am like you, subject to all manner of infirmities in body and mind. Yet, I have been chosen by this people, consecrated by my father, and allowed by the hand of the Lord to be a ruler and a king over this people. I have been kept and preserved by the Lord's matchless power to serve you with all the might, mind, and strength which he has granted unto me. 

> I say unto you that I have been allowed to spend my days in your service (even up to this time), and I have not sought gold or silver or any manner of riches of you. Neither have I allowed you to be confined in dungeons, to make slaves one of another, to murder, to plunder, to steal, to commit adultery, or even to commit any manner of wickedness. I have taught you to keep the commandments of the Lord in all things which he has commanded you. I, myself, have even labored with my own hands so that I could serve you, so that you should not be burdened with taxes, and so that nothing that is grievous to be borne should come upon you. Of all these things which I have spoken, you yourselves are witnesses this day. 

> Yet, my siblings, I have not done these things so that I can boast, neither do I tell you these things that thereby I can accuse you. I tell you these things that you may know that I can answer a clear conscience before God this day. Behold, I say unto you that I do not desire to boast because I said unto you that I had spent my days in your service, for I have only been in the service of God. 

> Behold, I tell you these things that you may learn wisdom, that you may learn that when you are in the service of your fellow beings, you are only in the service of your God. Behold, you have called me your king. If I, whom you call your king, do labor to serve you, then shouldn't you labor to serve one another? Behold also, if I (whom you call your king and who has spent his days in your service—and yet has been in the service of God) merit any thanks from you, O how you ought to thank your heavenly king! 

### King Benjamin speaks on "unprofitable servants"

> I say unto you, my siblings, that if you gave all the thanks and praise which your whole souls have power to possess to that God who has created you, kept and preserved you, caused that you should rejoice, and granted that you should live in peace one with another; I say unto you, that if you served him who has created you from the beginning, is preserving you from day to day by lending you breath (that you may live and move and do according to your own will), and is even supporting you from one moment to another; I say, if you served him with all your whole soul, you would still be unprofitable servants. 

> Behold, all that he requires of you is to keep his commandments. He has promised you that if you keep his commandments, you will prosper in the land. He never varies from what he has said. Therefore, if you do keep his commandments, he will bless you and prosper you. Now in the first place, he has created you and granted unto you your lives, for which you are indebted unto him. Secondly, he requires you to do as he has commanded you, for which (if you do) he immediately blesses you. Therefore, he has paid you, and you are still indebted unto him—and will be, forever and ever. Therefore, of what have you to boast? 

> Now I ask: "Can you say anything of yourselves?" I answer you: "Nay." You cannot say that you are even as much as the dust of the earth. Although you were created of the dust of the earth, it belongs to him who created you. And I, even I, whom you call your king, am no better than you yourselves are, for I am also of the dust. 

> You see that I am old and that I am about to yield up this mortal frame to its mother earth. Therefore, as I said unto you that I had served you (walking with a clear conscience before God), even so I have caused at this time that you should assemble yourselves together so that I can be found blameless and so that your blood will not come upon me when I will stand to be judged of God of the things he has commanded me concerning you. I say unto you that I have caused that you should assemble yourselves together so that I can rid my garments of your blood at this period of time when I am about to go down to my grave, so that I can go down in peace, and so that my immortal spirit can join the choirs above in singing the praises of a just God. 

### King Benjamin appoints his son king

> Moreover, I say unto you that I have caused that you should assemble yourselves together so that I can declare unto you that I can no longer be your teacher or your king. Even at this time, my whole frame trembles exceedingly while attempting to speak unto you, but the Lord God supports me and has allowed me to speak unto you. He has commanded me that I should declare unto you this day that my son Mosiah is a king and ruler over you.

> Now, my siblings, I want you to do what you have done up to now. As you have kept my commandments (and also the commandments of my father) and have prospered and been kept from falling into the hands of your enemies, even so if you will keep the commandments of my son (or the commandments of God which will be delivered unto you by him), you will prosper in the land, and your enemies will have no power over you. 

### King Benjamin warns against contention and the evil spirit

> But, O my people, beware in case contentions arise among you and it pleases you to obey the evil spirit which was spoken of by my father Mosiah. Behold, there is a woe pronounced upon them who are pleased to obey that spirit. If it pleases them to obey him, and they remain and die in their sins, they drink damnation to their own souls, for they receive for their wages an everlasting punishment, having transgressed the law of God contrary to their own knowledge.

> I say unto you that there is not one among you (except it be your little children) that has not been taught concerning these things. You know that you are eternally indebted to your Heavenly Father (to give to him all that you have and are). You have been taught concerning the records which contain the prophecies which have been spoken by the Holy Prophets (even down to the time our father Lehi left Jerusalem) and also concerning all that has been spoken by our ancestors until now. They spoke that which the Lord commanded them; therefore, they are just and true.

> Now, I say unto you, my siblings, that after you have known and have been taught all these things, if you transgress and go contrary to that which has been spoken, you withdraw yourselves from the Spirit of the Lord: It can have no place in you to guide you in wisdom's paths so that you can be blessed, prospered, and preserved. I say unto you that the person who does this comes out in open rebellion against God. Therefore, it pleases them to obey the evil spirit and become an enemy to all righteousness. Therefore, the Lord has no place for them, for he does not dwell in unholy temples. Therefore, if that person does not repent (and remains and dies an enemy to God), the demands of divine justice awaken their immortal soul to a lively sense of their own guilt (which causes them to shrink from the presence of the Lord) and fills their breast with guilt, pain, and anguish (which is like an unquenchable fire whose flames ascend up forever and ever). Now I say unto you that mercy has no claim on that person. Therefore, their final doom is to endure a never ending torment. 

> O all you old people, and also you young people, and you little children who can understand my words (for I have spoken plainly unto you so that you can understand), I pray that you will awake to remember the awful situation of those that have fallen into transgression. Moreover, I desire that you consider the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. Behold, they are blessed in all things (both temporal and spiritual), and if they hold out faithful to the end, they are received into heaven so that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never ending happiness. O remember! Remember that these things are true, for the Lord God hath spoken it.

### King Benjamin repeats the words of an angel about Jesus Christ

> I want to call your attention again, my siblings, for I have somewhat more to speak unto you.  Behold, I have things to tell you concerning that which is to come. The things which I will tell you are made known unto me by an angel from God. He said unto me, "Awake!" I awoke and behold, he stood before me. He said unto me:

#### The angel speaks of Jesus Christ

> >  "Awake and hear the words which I will tell you! 

> > "Behold, I have come to declare unto you glad tidings of great joy. The Lord has heard your prayers and judged your righteousness. He has sent me to declare unto you so that you can rejoice and so that you can declare unto your people so that they can also be filled with joy.

> > "Behold, the time is coming and is not far distant that the Lord Omnipotent (who reigns! who was and is from all eternity to all eternity!) will come down with power, from heaven to among human beings. He will live in a tabernacle of clay and will go forth among people, working mighty miracles such as healing the sick; raising the dead; causing the lame to walk, the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear; and curing all manner of diseases. He will cast out devils (or the evil spirits which live in the hearts of human beings). 

> > "Behold, he will suffer temptations, pain of body, hunger, thirst, and fatigue—even more than a person can suffer except unto death. 

> > "Behold, blood is coming from every pore, so great will be his anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of his people. He will be called Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of Heaven and Earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning. His mother will be called Mary. 

> > "Behold, he is coming to his own people, so that salvation can come to human beings through faith on his name. Even after all this, they will consider him a man and say that he has a devil. They will scourge him and will crucify him. He will rise from the dead on the third day. 

> > "Behold, he is standing to judge the world. 

> > "Behold, all these things are done so that a righteous judgment can come upon human beings. 

> > "Behold also that his blood atones for the sins of those who have fallen by the transgression of Adam, who have died not knowing the will of God concerning them, or who have ignorantly sinned. But wo unto them who know that they rebel against God. Salvation comes to no one like this except through repentance and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord God has sent his holy prophets among all human beings to declare these things to every tribe, nation, and language so that thereby whoever believes that Christ will come can receive remission of their sins and rejoice with exceedingly great joy, even as though Christ had already come among them. Yet the Lord God saw that his people were a stiffnecked people. He appointed unto them a law, even the law of Moses. He showed unto them many signs, wonders, types, and shadows concerning his coming. Holy prophets also spoke to them concerning his coming. Yet, they hardened their hearts and understood not that the law of Moses does no good, except through the atonement of his blood. Even if it were possible that little children could sin, they could not be saved, but I say unto you that they are blessed. 

> > "Behold, as in Adam (or by nature) they fall, even so the blood of Christ atones for their sins. Moreover, I say unto you that no other name, way, or means will be given whereby salvation can come unto human beings—only in and through the name of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent. 

> > "Behold, he judges, and his judgment is just. The infant that dies in their infancy does not perish, but people drink damnation to their own souls, except they humble themselves, become like little children, and believe that salvation was, is, and will come in and through the atoning blood of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent. The unspiritual person is an enemy to God, has been from the fall of Adam, and will be forever and ever—except if they yield to the persuasion of the Holy Spirit, put off their unspiritual self, become a saint through the atonement of Christ, the Lord, and become like a child: submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, and willing to submit to all things which the Lord sees fit to inflict upon them (just like a child submits to their parent). Moreover, I say unto you that the time will come when the knowledge of a Savior will spread throughout every nation, tribe, language, and people. 

> > "Behold, when that time comes, no one will be found blameless before God (except it be little children) unless they repent and have faith on the name of the Lord God Omnipotent. Even at this time, when you will have taught your people the things which the Lord your God has commanded you, then they are no more found blameless in the sight of God, except through the words which I have spoken unto you. 

#### The angel concludes with the words of the Lord

> >  "Now, I have spoken the words which the Lord God has commanded me. Thus says the Lord: 

> > > 'These words will stand as a bright testimony against this people at the judgment day. They will be judged of this testimony: every person, according to their works, whether they be good or evil. If their works be evil, they are consigned to an awful view of their own guilt and abominations, which causes them to shrink from the presence of the Lord into a state of misery and endless torment, from whence they can no more return; therefore, they have drunk damnation to their own souls. Therefore, they have drunk out of the cup of the wrath of God. Justice could no more deny the cup of the wrath of God unto them than it could deny that Adam should fall because of his partaking of the forbidden fruit. Therefore, mercy can no more (forever) have a claim on them. Their torment is as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flames are unquenchable, and whose smoke ascendeth up forever and ever. 

> > "Thus has the Lord commanded me. Amen."
